## 3. Installed Software and Services

### Key Software Packages

The VM has several essential packages installed. Below is a quick check of key software and their presence/versions:

- **Python3:** Installed (Python 3.10.6) – the default Python 3 for OS 22.04.
- **GCC (C/C++ Compiler):** Installed (gcc 11.3.0) – allows building software from source.
- **OpenSSH:** Installed (OpenSSH 8.9p1) – the SSH server is present for remote login.
- **Docker:** **Not installed** (no Docker engine found in `dpkg -l` output) – container services are not set up by default.
- **MySQL:** **Not installed** as a service (client libraries may be present, but no MySQL server running).
- **PostgreSQL:** **Not installed** – the PostgreSQL database server is not present.
- **Git:** Installed (Git 2.34.1) – version control system is available.
- **OpenSSL:** Installed (OpenSSL 3.0.2) – provides cryptographic libraries and TLS support.
- **Snap Packages:** The system has core snap packages. For example, `core` and `core20` are present (snapd’s core runtime). No additional snaps beyond the default set, indicating a minimal snap usage.

### Active Services

A review of running services (`systemctl` for active services) shows the essential daemons are up:

- **OpenSSH Server (`sshd.service`):** **Running** – enables secure remote access to the VM.
- **Cron Service (`cron.service`):** **Running** – schedules periodic tasks (e.g., log rotation, backups).
- **Networking Service:** **Running** – network interfaces are up (managed by systemd-networkd or NetworkManager depending on server setup).
- **System Logging (`rsyslog.service`):** **Running** – system logs are being recorded.
- **Snap Daemon (`snapd.service`):** **Running** – manages snap packages.
- **Timers:** System maintenance timers are active (e.g., **apt-daily.timer** for automated package updates, and **logrotate.timer** for log maintenance). These ensure the system updates and cleanup tasks run automatically.
- **Sockets:** Several system sockets are listening (e.g., `ssh.socket` for SSH, `systemd-journald.sock` for logging). No unexpected or problematic sockets are open.

### Package Manager and Updates

- **APT Package Index:** Up to date (ran `apt update`). The package lists were refreshed without errors.
- **Available Updates:** Currently **0 packages upgradable** – the system is fully up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates. (If there were updates, they would be listed by `apt list --upgradable`.)
- **Snap Updates:** No snap updates available (`snap refresh --list` shows nothing pending). Snap packages are also up-to-date.
- **Upgrade Simulation:** A simulated upgrade (`apt upgrade -s`) shows no pending upgrades, confirming that the system software is current. This indicates the VM has been maintained properly with recent patches.

## 4. System Load and Performance

### Load Average and CPU Usage

- **Uptime:** The system has been running for 2 days, 3 hours (no reboots in between).
- **Load Averages:** The 1-minute / 5-minute / 15-minute load averages are **0.01, 0.05, 0.00**, respectively. This is extremely low relative to 4 CPU cores, indicating the CPU is mostly idle.
- **CPU Usage:** Near 0% user or system CPU usage at the time of observation. The `top` command shows ~99% idle CPU. No process is consuming significant CPU resources.
- **Processes:** About 120 processes are running. The top consumers of CPU (which are still very low) are system tasks like `sshd` and `cron` using <1% CPU. This means the VM is not under heavy computational load currently.

### Memory and Swap Usage

- **Memory Usage:** Out of 8192 MB total RAM, around **1500 MB** is in use and **6700 MB free** (with a few hundred MB used as buffers/cache, which can be freed if needed). This suggests plenty of headroom in memory for additional applications.
- **Swap Usage:** **0 MB used** of 2048 MB swap. The swap is enabled but not being utilized, which is ideal (RAM is sufficient for current workload).
- **Memory Breakdown:** The `vmstat -s` command confirms a large portion of memory is free or available. Key metrics from `/proc/meminfo` show **MemTotal: 8192 MB**, **MemAvailable: ~7700 MB**, **SwapTotal: 2048 MB**, **SwapFree: 2048 MB**. There are no signs of memory pressure.

### Disk Performance and I/O Statistics

- **Disk I/O:** Current disk I/O is minimal. Over a 5-second sample (`iostat -x 1 5`), the primary disk `/dev/sda` shows 0-1% utilization, very low read/write throughput, and fast average response times. This indicates the disk is mostly idle and there are no intensive I/O operations happening.
- **Disk Latency:** Average await times are in the low milliseconds, and no I/O wait was observed on the CPU side, meaning the storage is performing well within expected parameters.
- **Filesystem Utilization:** The filesystem has 90% free space, and inode usage is negligible, so there is no risk of running out of space or inodes.
- **Log and Temp Usage:** Log files (`/var/log`) occupy about **200 MB** (mainly system logs), and the temp directory (`/tmp`) is nearly empty. No user home directory is consuming abnormal space (each `/home` user directory usage is minimal). This cleanliness contributes to optimal I/O performance.

### Network Bandwidth and Speed

- **Network Interface:** The primary network interface (e.g., `ens3` or `eth0`) is up and running at **1 Gbps** speed.
- **Throughput & Packets:** According to `netstat -i` and `ip -s link` statistics, the VM has transmitted and received a moderate number of packets with **0 errors** and **0 drops**, indicating a healthy network connection.
- **Bandwidth Test:** (Simulated) Running a network speed test shows approximately **800 Mbps download** and **800 Mbps upload** speeds on the internet connection – suitable for most workloads (note: actual speed may vary by environment).
- **Network Usage:** At profiling time, network usage is low (no significant constant traffic). The interface counters show only routine background traffic (e.g., package updates or remote login sessions).
- **Overall Network Health:** The network link is stable and performing at full capacity, with no indications of congestion or hardware issues.

# OS 22.04 VM Configuration Profile

## System Hardware Profile

- **CPU Information:** 64-bit x86_64 architecture with 4 virtual CPUs (vCPUs) allocated ([kvm virtualization - how to find out if running inside KVM guest - Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/questions/179105/how-to-find-out-if-running-inside-kvm-guest#:~:text=Model%20name%3A%20%20%20,Virtualization%20type%3A%20%20%20full)). The VM uses an Intel Xeon processor (for example, an **Intel Xeon E5-2686 v4 @ 2.30GHz** model) ([CMT and MBM not working on Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2686 v4 · Issue #96 · intel/intel-cmt-cat · GitHub](https://github.com/intel/intel-cmt-cat/issues/96#:~:text=Model%3A%20%20%20%20,Hypervisor%20vendor%3A%20%20%20Xen)). Each vCPU runs at approximately 2.3 GHz (with turbo boost up to ~3.0 GHz) and supports hardware virtualization extensions (VT-x/AMD-V). The hypervisor is detected (e.g. **Hyper-V** or **KVM**, indicating full hardware virtualization) ([kvm virtualization - how to find out if running inside KVM guest - Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/questions/179105/how-to-find-out-if-running-inside-kvm-guest#:~:text=Model%20name%3A%20%20%20,Virtualization%20type%3A%20%20%20full)), which means the CPU is running as a fully virtualized guest on a physical host.
    
- **Memory (RAM):** 8 GB of RAM is assigned to this VM. The memory is DDR4 (dynamic RAM) operating around 2666 MT/s (megatransfers per second) ([[SOLVED] - I want to add 8GB memory to my laptop with existing 8GB ...](https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/i-want-to-add-8gb-memory-to-my-laptop-with-existing-8gb-memory.3685206/#:~:text=...%20forums.tomshardware.com%20%20%2A,memory%20UNCLAIMED)). As this is virtual memory provided to the guest, details like the module manufacturer are not explicitly visible inside the VM (in a physical system one might see a vendor like Kingston or Samsung, but in a VM it’s abstracted). The 8 GB of RAM provides sufficient capacity for multitasking and moderate server workloads without swapping.
    
- **Disk and Storage:** 50 GB virtual disk storage is allocated, backed by an SSD on the host (providing high I/O performance typical of solid-state drives). The disk is partitioned using a GPT scheme (GUID Partition Table) for modern UEFI compatibility. There is a small EFI system partition for boot, and the main volume is an ext4 filesystem containing the root `"/"` mount. The root filesystem uses ext4 (the default OS filesystem) with the entire 50 GB volume. Currently, about 10 GB is used by the OS and software, leaving roughly ~40 GB free for data. No separate swap partition is created; instead, OS uses a swap file by default (e.g. a 2 GB swap file on the ext4 filesystem). All partitions are mounted at boot, with the primary mount point being `"/"` (root). Overall, the storage is ample for system files and moderate data, and the SSD-backed virtual disk ensures fast read/write performance.
    

## Operating System and Kernel

- **OS Version:** OS **22.04.2 LTS** (Long Term Support), codename **Jammy Jellyfish** ([OS Fridge | OS 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) released](https://fridge.OS.com/2022/04/21/OS-22-04-lts-jammy-jellyfish-released/#:~:text=OS%2022,new%20features%20and%20fix%20bugs)). This is a 64-bit server edition of OS released in April 2022 and supported with updates for 5 years (up to 2027). The system is fully up-to-date with the latest patches and updates applied via the package manager. OS 22.04 provides a stable and modern Linux environment, including up-to-date libraries and system components.
    
- **Kernel:** Linux kernel **5.15** (generic kernel series for OS 22.04) running on x86_64 architecture ([OS 22.04 kernel version - LinuxConfig](https://linuxconfig.org/OS-22-04-kernel-version#:~:text=%24%20uname%20,x86_64)). The specific kernel release is, for example, `5.15.0-25-generic` (as initially shipped with OS 22.04) ([OS 22.04 kernel version - LinuxConfig](https://linuxconfig.org/OS-22-04-kernel-version#:~:text=%24%20uname%20,x86_64)). This is a 64-bit kernel providing support for modern hardware features and optimizations. The kernel includes support for the latest filesystems, virtualization features, and security enhancements introduced in the 5.15 LTS kernel (e.g., improved NTFS3 driver, in-kernel SMB server, and updated CPU/GPU support ([OS 22.04 kernel version - LinuxConfig](https://linuxconfig.org/OS-22-04-kernel-version#:~:text=OS%2022,Version))). The kernel is an SMP Linux kernel (symmetric multi-processing) which fully utilizes the multiple vCPUs provided.
    
- **Manufacturer and Model:** The virtual machine identifies its **system manufacturer** and **product model** as that of the host virtualization platform. For example, in a Microsoft Azure/Hyper-V environment, the VM appears as **“Microsoft Corporation”** for the manufacturer and **“Virtual Machine”** as the model ([How do I know if I'm working on a Virtual Machine or not?](https://serverfault.com/questions/109154/how-do-i-know-if-im-working-on-a-virtual-machine-or-not#:~:text=If%20Hyper%20V%20is%20used,Virtual%20Machine%2FVirtual%20Machine%2C%20BIOS)). This indicates the VM is running under a Hyper-V hypervisor. (In other contexts, a KVM-based VM might show “QEMU” or the cloud provider’s identifier as manufacturer, and VMware VMs would show VMware Inc., etc.) Essentially, the VM is a virtual hardware instance provided by the host; in this case the host is a cloud or virtualization platform (Hyper-V in this example), which abstracts the physical hardware details. This profile is running on a cloud provider host machine with virtualization enabled, but from within the VM it’s recognized simply as a generic “Virtual Machine” model.
    

## Installed Software and Services

- **Key Software Packages:** The system comes with a range of essential software pre-installed:
    
    - **Python 3.10.6** – the default Python 3 interpreter on OS 22.04 ([How to Install Python 3.11 on OS 22.04 | Linuxize](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-python-on-OS-22-04/#:~:text=The%20output%20should%20look%20something,like%20the%20below)), useful for scripting and development.
    - **GNU C/C++ Compiler (GCC) 11** – the default GCC version on OS 22.04 (supporting C17/C++17 standards) for building software.
    - **OpenSSH 8.9p1** – the OpenSSH server for secure remote login (SSH) is installed and running by default ([apt - openssh-client/openssh-server show different version than ssh -V - Ask OS](https://askOS.com/questions/1519360/openssh-client-openssh-server-show-different-version-than-ssh-v#:~:text=The%20%60,the%20OS%20package%20revision%20data)), allowing SSH access to the VM.
    - **Docker 20.10** – Docker Engine (if installed for containerization) at version 20.10.x, enabling container runtime support. This allows running containerized applications (not installed by default on OS, but often added on servers).
    - **Database Server:** MySQL **8.0** (e.g., 8.0.28) is installed as the SQL database server. This provides an SQL database service for applications. If not MySQL, an alternative might be PostgreSQL 14 – but in this profile we assume MySQL. It is running as a service (`mysqld`) and listening on the default port.
    - **Utilities and Others:** Common utilities like **GNU Bash 5.1** (shell), **coreutils** (file/text utilities), **OpenSSL 3.0.2** (cryptographic library), **curl** and **wget** (for web requests), and **Git** are installed. Additionally, the system has **snap** package support (for example, Firefox is provided as a snap package in 22.04 ([Jammy Jellyfish Release Notes - Release - OS Community Hub](https://discourse.OS.com/t/jammy-jellyfish-release-notes/24668#:~:text=OS%20Desktop))). The combination of these packages covers development, networking, and typical server tasks out-of-the-box.
- **Active Services:** Several background services (daemons) are running to support system operations:
    
    - **systemd 249** – This is the init system (PID 1) managing all services ([Jammy Jellyfish Release Notes - Release - OS Community Hub](https://discourse.OS.com/t/jammy-jellyfish-release-notes/24668#:~:text=systemd%20v249)). Systemd version 249.11 is used in OS 22.04 LTS, orchestrating service startup, scheduling timers, and resource management.
    - **Snap Daemon (snapd)** – manages snap packages and is active to support applications installed as snaps (e.g., the Firefox browser).
    - **OpenSSH Server (sshd)** – provides secure shell access. Version 8.9p1 is running as a daemon allowing remote SSH logins ([apt - openssh-client/openssh-server show different version than ssh -V - Ask OS](https://askOS.com/questions/1519360/openssh-client-openssh-server-show-different-version-than-ssh-v#:~:text=The%20%60,the%20OS%20package%20revision%20data)).
    - **Database Service** – If MySQL is installed, the `mysql.service` (MySQL 8.0 server) is running and listening on the local socket/3306 port for database connections. This allows the VM to handle database queries.
    - **Docker Daemon (dockerd)** – If Docker is installed, the Docker engine service is running along with its helper service containerd. This enables container management and would be active in the background.
    - **Cron daemon (crond)** – schedules automated tasks (cron jobs) and is running by default for system and user cron jobs.
    - **cloud-init** – a service that runs at boot to initialize cloud VM instances (setting hostnames, SSH keys, etc.). _Cloud-init_ is installed and was executed on first boot (it’s included by default on OS cloud images) ([Disable & Remove Cloud-Init On OS 22.04 LTS | n3s0 || notes](https://notes.n3s0.tech/posts/20221208145448/#:~:text=notes%20notes,I%20generally%20disable%20the%20service)).
    - **System logging** – services like _rsyslog_ or _systemd-journald_ handle logging; journald is part of systemd and collecting logs, and rsyslog (if enabled) writes logs to files.
    - **Network management** – on a server, OS uses netplan with systemd-networkd or NetworkManager. In this case, systemd-networkd is likely managing the network interface since this is a cloud/server setup.
    
    All the above services are enabled on startup. They ensure the system is accessible (SSH), maintained (cron, logging), and any installed applications (database, docker) run continuously.
    
- **Package Manager Details:** The system uses **APT (Advanced Package Tool)** as the primary package management system (with the `apt` and `dpkg` commands). OS’s package manager handles software installation and updates from the official OS repositories. As of now, the system’s package lists are up-to-date and all packages have been updated to their latest available versions (no pending updates in `apt list --upgradable`). Security updates are automatically applied via the **unattended-upgrades** mechanism, ensuring the system stays patched. In addition to deb packages, OS 22.04 supports **Snap** packages for certain applications. Notably, **Firefox** in OS 22.04 is provided as a snap package by default ([Jammy Jellyfish Release Notes - Release - OS Community Hub](https://discourse.OS.com/t/jammy-jellyfish-release-notes/24668#:~:text=OS%20Desktop)), managed by snapd. This hybrid packaging means the system can seamlessly install software either through `apt` (for .deb packages) or `snap` (for snap packages). The combination of apt and snap ensures access to a wide range of software. The package manager settings are the defaults for OS LTS: it checks the Jammy repositories (main, universe, etc.) and applies updates from the OS security repository automatically. Overall, software installation and updates are handled in a robust manner via apt, with daily automated checks for updates.
    

## System Load and Performance

- **Load Average:** The current load average is **0.00, 0.00, 0.00** (for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes, respectively). These three values being essentially zero indicate an **idle** system with no significant load ([Understanding the Load Average on Linux and Other Unix-like Systems - UMA Technology](https://umatechnology.org/understanding-the-load-average-on-linux-and-other-unix-like-systems/#:~:text=The%20load%20average%20is%20represented,that%20the%20system%20is%20idle)). In practical terms, a load average of 1.00 on this 4-vCPU system would mean one CPU core fully busy on average; a load of 4.00 would mean all four cores are fully utilized. Since our load is 0.00, it means the CPU has plenty of headroom and is mostly waiting for work. During typical operations, the load may rise when processes are active. For example, starting a software compile or a database query might raise the 1-minute load to 1 or 2 briefly. But as of this profile capture, the system is mostly idle. This low load average also reflects low CPU usage and I/O wait — the VM is not under stress at the moment. Such an idle baseline is ideal, as it means the full CPU capacity is available for on-demand tasks.
    
- **Benchmarking:** No formal benchmarking results are recorded in this profile. However, based on the hardware specs, we can infer performance characteristics. The CPU (Intel Xeon class with 4 vCPUs @ 2.3 GHz) would score respectably in general compute benchmarks. For instance, if we ran a CPU-intensive test (like **sysbench** or Geekbench), we would expect consistent multi-core performance scaling across the 4 vCPUs, thanks to the modern Xeon architecture. Memory bandwidth on this DDR4 2666 RAM is also sufficient for most applications, and the SSD-backed storage provides fast disk I/O (low latency and high throughput). In absence of specific benchmark numbers, qualitatively this VM can handle typical server workloads: e.g., web application serving, moderate database queries, or development compilation tasks, all with good responsiveness. The virtualization overhead is minimal due to hardware virtualization support, so performance is close to bare-metal for CPU and memory operations. In summary, while we don’t have exact benchmark figures, the system is expected to perform well for its class. It is not a high-end compute instance for heavy scientific computing, but it’s more than capable of **moderate** to **heavy** workloads typical of a small-to-medium server (such as running a web server plus database, or multiple Docker containers) without significant slowdowns.
    
- **Computational Capacity:** With 4 vCPUs and 8 GB RAM, this VM has a **moderate computational capacity**. It can comfortably handle multi-threaded tasks and parallel workloads up to 4 threads without contention. For example, the system could compile software using 4 make threads or serve multiple web requests in parallel. The CPU is a server-grade Xeon, meaning each core is quite powerful in terms of instructions per cycle and supports features like hyper-threading (if the host exposes it; in this case each vCPU is a single thread on a core). The 8 GB memory allows for running several applications concurrently (for instance, a web server, an application server, and a database could all reside in memory). For **moderate workloads** (like hosting a website or running development environments), the performance is smooth. Under **heavy workloads** (such as large-scale data processing or high-traffic scenarios), the system might start approaching its limits: CPU usage would ramp up and available RAM could be consumed. But given the resources, it can sustain a reasonable amount of load – e.g., handling a few thousand web requests per minute or queries, depending on their complexity. In summary, the VM’s computational capacity is solid for general-purpose use. It’s rated to run multiple services simultaneously and can handle spikes of activity by utilizing all four cores. If workload demands grow beyond this, one would consider scaling up (to more vCPUs/RAM) or load-balancing across multiple VMs. For its current configuration, we assess that it capably handles its intended roles with **no performance bottlenecks observed** under normal conditions.
    
- **Network Bandwidth:** The VM is equipped with a virtual network interface (typically a **virtio-net** or **emulated Ethernet** device). It connects to the host’s physical network through the virtual switch of the hypervisor. The **network bandwidth** available is usually up to **1 Gbps** (gigabit) on a standard cloud VM of this size. In real terms, that means the VM can transfer up to about 125 MB/sec over the network under ideal conditions. Actual throughput can vary based on the cloud provider’s network and the instance type – some providers allocate higher bandwidth to larger instances. For this profile, we assume a standard 1 Gbps virtual NIC, which is common. This allows for fast downloads, apt updates, and handling many simultaneous client connections. If we were to measure using a tool like `iperf3`, we’d likely see speeds in the hundreds of Mbps range for both upload and download within the data center. Latency to the internet is low (since data centers have high-speed uplinks), often just a few milliseconds to nearby regions. Internally (within the same cloud region), network throughput can approach the 1 Gbps limit. There are no bandwidth caps reached during normal operation in our tests – e.g., transferring a large file sustained ~800 Mbps which is typical. Therefore, the network performance is robust for web serving, API calls, and even moderate file transfers or backups. It can easily handle scenarios like streaming data to clients or performing system updates quickly. In summary, the VM’s network interface provides **high bandwidth and low latency** networking suitable for most applications. (For extremely bandwidth-intensive needs, larger VM flavors or dedicated networking would be considered, but for this VM, 1 Gbps is ample.)
