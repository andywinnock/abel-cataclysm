## Mixins & Access

- Mixins
  - Config file: [cataclysm.mixins.json](mdc:src/main/resources/cataclysm.mixins.json)
  - Package: `com.github.L_Ender.cataclysm.mixin`
  - Ensure mixin names are added to the appropriate array (`mixins` or `client`), keep compatibility level `JAVA_17`, and refmap `cataclysm.refmap.json`.
  - The Gradle mixin block already registers configs and refmaps: see [build.gradle](mdc:build.gradle)

- Access transformers
  - File: [accesstransformer.cfg](mdc:src/main/resources/META-INF/accesstransformer.cfg)
  - Add only what is necessary; prefer ATs over coremods; keep entries stable across MC/Forge versions.
